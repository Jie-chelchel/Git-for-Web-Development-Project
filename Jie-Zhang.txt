1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
Answer: Inline element only takes up as much width as needed, and it doesn't start on a new line.
        Block element always takes up the full width available, and always starts on a new line.
        A block element has a top and bottom margin, where as an inline element does not.




2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
Answer: it willl be positioned relative to the first relatively or absolutely positioned parent element. 
        If there is no positioned parent element, it will be positioned related directly to the page itself.





3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it 
   a width? 
Answer: I think we can use flex-basis to give an element a width, but also use flex-grow, flex-shrink to create
        flexible layouts so the element can fully adapt to the spage it has. Not very clear if this is right :( 


4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default, and 1 
   element that is display inline-block by default
Answer: block elements: <div>, <ul>, <article>, <h1>;
        inline elements: <a>, <img>;
        inline-block elements: <button>?

   
5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
Answer: Everything is CSS has a box around it. You can add padding and border to the box.  
        This will change the size of the box. For example, if you set width and height to be 200px for 
        two boxes, but one has padding 5px, and the other doesn't. Then they will look differently. 
        Sometimes it will cause problems. The fix is using box-sizing:border-box. box-sizing:border-box 
        include padding and borders in an element's width. With box-sizing:border-box, the two box I mentioned
        above, will look the same in size.
